- title: Janitor Boss
  description: Had the idea of this old wizard roaming around dungeons in a game. Maybe you see him and he just looks like the janitor that appear throughout every level seemingly harmless. But then he turns out to be the boss at the end of the game!! What the what!? crazy stuff. Spent the beginning of this idea on my beloved sketch pad, then scanned it in and decided to work off one greyscale layer. Like the end result.‹›×

- title: Silent Goblin
  description: I really wanted to focus on a pose with balance and character in its posture. I hoped my mouthless monster would embrace his confidence and curiosity when discovering a bottle for the first time. His people require no food and thus have not seen a washed up bottle before.

- title: Dwarf Sketch
  description: I love fantasy dwarves because they have a great design while typically carrying a lot of ruggedness in their faces. I worked destructively to press myself to discover and not think too much. I wanted some color changes in shadows to make sure the deep face lines didn't turn into black holes. Im happy with the cartoony look.

- title: Malmerra
  description: Trying to mix my love of comics into a digital painting, where i tried to stylize facial features while keeping some natural lighting and shading. The electrically suspended arms were an answer to wanting to throw in some warm bounce light.

- title: Girl on a Sweet Moped
  description: I wanted a background that was detailed but didn't draw focus away from my subject. I like the idea of brick but didn't want to overlay a detailed photo texture that would conflict with the soft brush style i used on this hellion hipster.

- title: Storyboard 1
  description: These Storyboard shots were for a music video about a seductive spy who lures another spy into a world of espionage, action, and betrayal. My goal was to focus on camera angles and mood as quickly as possible to give the client an idea within a tight timeframe. These each were done in about 5-10 minutes.

- title: Gateway to the Garden
  description: Another from my story of a brother and sited stumbling upon adventure while on the run from invading warlords. Started as a thumbnail for a storyboard on this series. Wanted to try a new color palette that was fantastical and striking. Happy with the color choices as this series moves into a lighter tone once stumbling upon this mystical cavern.

- title: Bloom
  description: This sprite was meant to focus more on form and attitude than over-rendering and shading. I tried to take advantage of working digitally and not over shading by finding sudden shifts in tone and bolstering the edges for a neat effect. It outlined her with cyans and made her pop just a bit more.

- title: The Breath
  description: Trying a new work flow on one of my old characters. Started from scratch on an into us with a simple grayscale version looking for tones stemming from bottom lighting. The galaxy was made from soft brushes under tighter strokes to give some depth in the cloud. I chose to keep him bare as the idea is an archaic creator/concept that is given form to tell where galaxies are born.Trying a new work flow on one of my old characters.

  description: Enjoying repetitive pen work, I wanted to define my own style with a new subject. I created an ethereal cloud-like tempest with arching line work, and a negative space to serve as forefront cloud streams.

  description: This is one of my hand penned works that indulges my need for repetitive chaos all wrapped in a preconceived idea for an illustration. I love drawing hair and I wanted this piece to have symmetry.This is one of my hand penned works that indulges my need for repetitive chaos all wrapped in a preconceived idea for an illustration.
